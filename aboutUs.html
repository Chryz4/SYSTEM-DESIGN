                <p>
                    The University of Plymouth is renowned worldwide for its high-quality research, teaching and
                    innovation.
                    With a mission to Advance Knowledge and Transform Lives, the University drives the global debate
                    in
                    disciplines from marine and maritime to medicine, law, computing and climate action.</p>

                <p>A three-time winner of the Queen’s Anniversary Prize for Higher and Further Education – most
                    recently in
                    respect of its pioneering research on microplastics pollution in the ocean – Plymouth
                    consistently ranks
                    among the world’s leading universities for its innovation, research and teaching in relation to
                    the
                    United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. In the 2021 Research Excellence Framework, 78% of
                    its
                    research was assessed as world-leading or internationally-excellent, with nine subject areas
                    seeing 100%
                    of their submission rated in the highest categories for impact.</p>

                <p>In recognition of its efforts to reduce the impact of campus activities on the environment, the
                    University has been verified carbon neutral. The independent PAS 2060 verification acknowledges
                    a
                    reduction in emissions of 78% since 2005, with the University more than halving its carbon
                    footprint
                    since 1990, and significantly reducing its water usage, waste, and business travel. This has
                    enabled it
                    to achieve its initial net zero ambition three years ahead of target, and the University
                    continues to
                    invest in a sustainable future through upgrades to its estate.</p>
